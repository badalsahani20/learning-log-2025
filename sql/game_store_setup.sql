-- SQL Script: Game Store Database Setup and Practice Queries

-- =====================================================================
-- PART 1: DATABASE SETUP AND SCHEMA DEFINITION (DDL)
-- =====================================================================

-- ❓ Create the main database for the game store.
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS game_store_db;
-- ❓ Select the newly created database for use.
USE game_store_db;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Table 1: developers
-- ❓ Create the 'developers' table to store information about game studios.
CREATE TABLE developers (
    developer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100),
    founded_year INT
);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Table 2: games
-- ❓ Create the 'games' table, linking to 'developers' via Foreign Key.
CREATE TABLE games (
    game_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    genre VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(6,2),
    release_year INT,
    developer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (developer_id) REFERENCES developers(developer_id)
);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Table 3: players
-- ❓ Create the 'players' table to track user information.
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    country VARCHAR(100)
);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Table 4: purchases
-- ❓ Create the 'purchases' table to record transactions, linking players and games.
CREATE TABLE purchases (
    purchase_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    player_id INT,
    game_id INT,
    purchase_date DATE,
    quantity INT DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(game_id)
);


-- =====================================================================
-- PART 2: DATA INSERTION (DML)
-- =====================================================================

-- ❓ Insert initial data for the developers.
INSERT INTO developers (name, country, founded_year) VALUES
('FromSoftware', 'Japan', 1986),
('Santa Monica Studios', 'USA', 1999),
('CD Project Red', 'Poland', 2002),
('Rockstar Games', 'USA', 1998),
('Nintendo', 'Japan', 1889);

-- ❓ Insert initial data for the games, linking them to their developers.
INSERT INTO games (title, genre, price, release_year, developer_id) VALUES
('Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice', 'Action', 59.99, 2019, 1),
('God of War', 'Action', 49.99, 2018, 2),
('Cyberpunk 2077', 'RPG', 69.99, 2020, 2),
('GTA V', 'Action', 39.99, 2013, 4),

(2, 4, '2024-01-18', 1),
(1, 5, '2024-01-19', 1);

-- =====================================================================
-- PART 3: PRACTICE QUERIES (DQL)
-- =====================================================================

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. Basic Selection and Filtering
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ❓ Retrieve all columns and all rows from the 'games' table.
SELECT * FROM games;

-- ❓ Show only the title and price for every game.
SELECT title, price FROM games;

-- ❓ Find all player records for users located in 'India'.
SELECT * FROM players WHERE country = 'India';

-- ❓ List the titles of all games released after the year 2018.
SELECT title FROM games WHERE release_year > 2018;

-- ❓ List the titles of all games priced over 50.
SELECT title FROM games WHERE price > 50;

-- ❓ Find all games with a price between 40 and 60 (inclusive).
SELECT * FROM games WHERE price BETWEEN 40 AND 60;

-- ❓ Show all players who are NOT from the 'USA'.
SELECT * FROM players WHERE country <> 'USA';

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 2. Ordering, Unique Values, and Pattern Matching
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ❓ Get all player usernames, sorted in alphabetical (ascending) order.
SELECT username FROM players ORDER BY username ASC;

-- ❓ List all unique genres available in the 'games' table.
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM games;

-- ❓ Find all games whose title contains the word 'Sekiro' anywhere.
SELECT * FROM games WHERE title LIKE '%Sekiro%';

-- ❓ List all games whose title starts with the letter 'G'.
SELECT * FROM games WHERE title LIKE 'G%';

-- ❓ List all games, sorted by price from highest to lowest (descending).
SELECT * FROM games ORDER BY price DESC;

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 3. Complex Filtering (AND/OR)
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ❓ Find all games cheaper than 55 AND released after 2018.
SELECT * FROM games WHERE price < 55 AND release_year > 2018;

-- SQL Script: Advanced JOIN and Aggregation Queries for Game Store

-- =====================================================================
-- 1. INNER JOIN: Matching Records Only
-- =====================================================================

-- ❓ Query: List all games and the name of their developer. (Standard INNER JOIN)
-- 💡 Result: Only shows games that have a matching developer in the developers table.
SELECT
    G.title,
    D.name
FROM games AS G
INNER JOIN developers AS D
ON G.developer_id = D.developer_id;


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

-- ❓ Query: Get a list of every purchase, showing the player's username, the game title, and the purchase date. (Multi-Table INNER JOIN)
-- 💡 Result: Joins three tables (Purchases, Players, Games) to display transaction details.
SELECT
    P.username AS player,
    G.title AS game,
    PU.purchase_date
FROM purchases AS PU
JOIN players AS P ON PU.player_id = P.player_id
JOIN games AS G ON PU.game_id = G.game_id;


-- =====================================================================
-- 2. LEFT JOIN: Including Unmatched Records
-- =====================================================================

-- ❓ Query: List all games and their developer name. If a game exists without a developer (though unlikely with Foreign Key constraints), still list the game with a NULL developer name.
-- 💡 Result: Guarantees every row from the 'games' (LEFT) table is included.
SELECT
    G.title AS Title,
    D.name AS Developer
FROM games AS G
LEFT JOIN developers AS D
ON G.developer_id = D.developer_id;


-- ❓ Query: Count the total number of games for each developer, including developers who have released zero games. (LEFT JOIN with GROUP BY)
-- 💡 Result: Every developer will be listed, and their game count will be 0 if no match exists.
SELECT
    d.name AS developer,
    COUNT(g.game_id) AS total_games
FROM developers AS d
LEFT JOIN games AS g
    ON d.developer_id = g.developer_id
GROUP BY d.name;


-- ❓ Query: Calculate the total revenue generated by each game. (LEFT JOIN with Aggregation)
-- 💡 Result: Lists every game and its total calculated revenue (SUM of quantity * price). Using LEFT JOIN ensures games with zero purchases are included (revenue will be 0 or NULL).
SELECT
    g.title AS Game,
    SUM(pu.quantity * g.price) AS Revenue
FROM purchases AS pu
LEFT JOIN games AS g
    ON g.game_id = pu.game_id
GROUP BY g.title;


-- =====================================================================
-- 3. Advanced Aggregation and Grouping
-- =====================================================================

-- ❓ Query: Calculate the total revenue earned by each developer across all their games. (Multi-JOIN and SUM)
-- 💡 Result: Sums up revenue for all games that belong to a specific developer.
SELECT
    d.name AS Developer,
    SUM(g.price * pu.quantity) AS Total_revenue
FROM developers AS d
JOIN games AS g
    ON d.developer_id = g.developer_id
JOIN purchases AS pu
    ON g.game_id = pu.game_id
GROUP BY d.name;


-- ❓ Query: Calculate the total amount of money each player has spent, sorted from highest spender to lowest. (Multi-JOIN, SUM, and ORDER BY)
-- 💡 Result: Provides a leaderboard of players based on their total spending.
SELECT
    p.username AS Player,
    SUM(pu.quantity * g.price) AS Total_Spent
FROM purchases AS pu
JOIN games AS g
    ON g.game_id = pu.game_id
JOIN players AS p
    ON p.player_id = pu.player_id
GROUP BY p.username
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC;


-- ❓ Query: Find all developers who have released more than one game. (GROUP BY with HAVING)
-- 💡 Result: Filters the results of the COUNT aggregation. The WHERE clause cannot be used here because it filters rows before aggregation occurs.
SELECT
    d.name AS Developer,
    COUNT(g.game_id) AS Total_Games
FROM developers AS d
JOIN games AS g
    ON d.developer_id = g.developer_id
GROUP BY d.name
HAVING COUNT(g.game_id) > 1;

# Advanced SQL Notes – Player, Games & Aggregations

## 1️⃣ Total Money Spent + Games Purchased per Player
